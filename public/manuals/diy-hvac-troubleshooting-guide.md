# DIY HVAC Troubleshooting Guide

## Initial Safety Checks
1. **Check Circuit Breakers**
   - Locate your electrical panel
   - Look for tripped HVAC breakers (usually labeled)
   - If tripped, switch completely off then back on
   - Wait 30 minutes for system reset if breaker was tripped

2. **Inspect Drain System**
   - Check condensate drain pan for water accumulation
   - Look for triggered float switch (safety device that stops AC if drain is blocked)
   - Clear any visible blockages in drain line
   - If float switch is triggered, system won't run until drain issue is resolved

## System Operation Verification

3. **Indoor Air Handler Check**
   - Listen for blower motor operation
   - Check for airflow from vents
   - Verify filter is clean and properly installed
   - Ensure all vents are open and unobstructed

4. **Outdoor Unit Inspection**
   - Check if condenser fan is spinning
   - Listen for compressor operation
   - Clear debris around unit (leaves, grass, etc.)
   - Ensure unit has proper clearance (2-3 feet) on all sides

5. **Temperature Verification**
   - Locate larger copper line (suction line)
   - When system is running properly:
     * Should feel cold to touch
     * Should have condensation/frost in humid conditions
   - If line isn't cold, could indicate:
     * Low refrigerant
     * Compressor issues
     * System not running properly

## When to Call a Professional
- If breaker keeps tripping
- No cold air after basic troubleshooting
- Unusual noises from either unit
- Water leaks that persist after drain cleaning
- Frozen evaporator coil
- Burning smells or electrical odors

## Regular Maintenance Tips
1. Replace/clean air filters monthly
2. Keep outdoor unit clear of debris
3. Clean condensate drain line quarterly
4. Schedule professional maintenance annually

**SAFETY NOTE:** Never attempt repairs beyond these basic checks. Working with electrical components and refrigerant requires professional licensing and expertise.
